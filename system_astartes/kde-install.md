# First Boot

- Upgrades the system and adds the multimedia stuff.
- Installs Cockpit (remote management), git, and xclip whichmakes it easier to setup the system.

```bash
sudo dnf group upgrade --with-optional Multimedia

# Enable remote management (but don't start the webserver)
sudo dnf install cockpit git xclip
```

## SDDM

Confirm you are using SDDM WAYLAND! You probably aren't.

```bash
sudo dnf install sddm-wayland-plasma

# If â†‘ tells you there is nothing to do, you are done.
# But if it returns an error:
sudo dnf swap sddm-x11 sdd-wayland

# Yeah yeah yeah. This is KDE install. But having a fall back is nice.
# And sometimes things just work a little better with some of this installed.
# And it takes less room than LaTeX does . . . . 
sudo dnf group install "Fedora Workstation"
```
