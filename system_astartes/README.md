# About

Desktop install script for `astartes`, which is usually the name I give to my primary personal laptop. This system spends most of its time plugged in, but I do use it for teaching, programming in the living room, etc. This is the only system I tend to simply administer directly. This is partially a security measure because this laptop leaves the house fairly frequently.

- Operating System: Fedora Workstation
- Desktop: Gnome or KDE
- Goal: Personal work, teaching, data science, programming
