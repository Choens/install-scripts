# README

Contains installation "scripts" and notes for my personal laptops, workstations,
and servers. From one install to the next, I (try to) keep my systems consistent.

My long-term goal is to embrace containers for my development. This means I'll be able to have a consistent set of containerized apps running on (possibly) more than one machine. I will probably split some of these containers into a separate "containers" repo as this matures.

After Fedora 40 comes out, I'm going to assess the potential for moving to a "atomic" image. I expect to do this transition incrementally.

# Systems

Each system has a folder, specific to that system. There is significant overlap, but they are unique. The folder, common, contains a set of topic-specific guides which are sometimes useful for more than one system, depending on circumstances.

- Astartes: My primary laptop.
- Euphrati: My daughter's laptop.
- Primarch: Local server
