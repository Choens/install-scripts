# Gnome Extension Manager

Using within GNOME Extension Manager, I install:

- Clipboard Indicator
- Tactile



# Flat Seal

- Are Flatpaks great? Yes
- Are they perfect? Not yet!

I maintain a list of flatpak specific tweaks I make via Flat Seal.

- LibreOffice
    - Enable D-Bus session bus
- Code (Visual Studio Code)
    - Make sure you have enabled 

# Firefox

I have multiple profiles:

- Andy (Personal) 
- ACPHS

Each email address has an Firefox account. FF will then send you the code.
This will sync extensions, bookmarks, etc.



# Mail

- Use Gnome Online Accounts for Google/GMail.
- Use MS Edge for Outlook (install a web-app)



# VS Code (Flatpak)

If you are drowning in messages that look like this:

```
[304 preload-host-spawn-strategy] Warning: waitpid override ignores groups
```

Add the following to your config (settings.json), restart VSCode and all should be well.

```json
  "terminal.integrated.env.linux": {
    "LD_PRELOAD": null,
  },
```

Getting podman working . . . takes some work.

```bash
flatpak override --user --filesystem=xdg-run/podman com.visualstudio.com
```

# Zoom

On first start, you will get the following message:

> Wayland screen sharing is not yet enabled. 
> Please restart Zoom for it to automatically enable, or manually change the value of "enableWaylandShare" to "true" in "/home/andy/.var/app/us.zoom.Zoom/config/zoomus.conf".

I recommend doing what the nice message tells us to do. 

And then you have one more hoop to jump through. It _still_ didn't work for me, but I found this link:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/16n1c0j/for_anybody_having_issues_with_zoom_screen/

When I tried to share my screen, the window popped up but it didn't include options to share my desktop and/or screen. But you can fix it:

- Open Zoom settings (cog icon).
- Go to Share Screen -> Advanced.
- Change Screen capture mode on Wayland to Pipewire Mode.

And now everything should work and you don't even have to restart Zoom.
