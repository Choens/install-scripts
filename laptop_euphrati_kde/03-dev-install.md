# About

- I try to keep my base system as minimal as possible.



# Containers

This is a WIP. I am trying to figure out how to use Podman to build and serve VSCode devcontainers.



## Container: r-geospatial

- TODO: Link to repo
- Follow directions in the README


# Python

I have almost completely moved my direct development to containers. BUT, I do still like to be able program in Python more directly.
